= Programming meets story telling

== Introduction

== Arrays can twist your brain
=== Find the Max Sum of a Contiguous Sequence

[source,bash]
----
Input - [1, -1, 0]
Result - 1

Input - [-1, -6, -5, 0]
Result - 0

Input - [1, 1, 1, -2, 4, 5]
Result - 10
----

==== How to solve in a single loop
[source, bash]
----
This talks about contiguous sequence. 
Imagine this like some kind of sort. 
Hopefully a single pass i.e O(N) is enough
----

==== When to include & when to avoid negatives
[source,bash]
----
Relax. 
Try solving the max sum part. 
Use the canonical Comparison & Swap logic FIRST to make a headstart.
----

==== Handling Multiple Combinations is Tricky
[source,bash]
----
Sum can grow as well as reduce. 
Who knows the next item will grow the sum further.
----

==== Is there any Trick?
[source,bash]
----
Consider two variables Max_SUM & Current_SUM

NOTE: Do not let the Current_SUM to be less than 0 @ a Special Condition
NOTE: This helps us manage many many combinations easily
----

==== Source Code
[source,go]
----
func MaxSum(given []int) int {
  if len(given) == 0 return 0
  if len(given) == 1 return given[0]
  
  // IMP - no need to init MIN INT
  var maxSum = given[0]
  var currMax = 0
  for (i:=0;i<len(given)-1;i++) {
    currMax += given[i]
    if maxSum < currMax {
      maxSum = currMax
    } else if currMax < 0 { // else if is VERY IMP
      currMax = 0
    }
  }
  return maxSum
}
