= Fun With Programming

== Introduction
In this journey, I practice programming and keep my brain sharp.
I will try to put more common sense information that in turn lets the brain
frame the logic fast.

== Connect The Dots - Golang
[source, bash]
----
- str[idx] is bytes
- rune(str[idx]) is rune
- str[left:right+1] is the substring
- sometimes str[left:right] based on the logic
----

[source, bash]
----
- map[int]bool as seen
- map[rune]bool as seen
- if seen then reset
- reset to empty?
- reset to current element?
----

[source, bash]
----
- 10^i will not work
- try PowerOf10(pow int) int
- if arithmetic overflow
----

[source, bash]
----
- rune is an alias for int32 
  - mnemonic - ruined international man
- byte is an alias for unit8
  - mnemonic - bye to unify
- unit implies all positive numbers including 0
- uint ranges from 0 to 4294967295  
- int ranges from â€“2147483648 to 2147483647 
----

[source, bash]
----
size := len(arr)    // SOME ARRAY
top := arr[size-1]  // LAST ELEMENT
arr = arr[:size-1]  // MUTATE TO REMOVE LAST ELEM
