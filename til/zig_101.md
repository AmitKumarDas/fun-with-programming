##### Takeaways
```yaml
- C ABI Compatibility
- Build Mode
- Inline Function
- Symbol Table
- External Function Prototype
- Symbols of Header Files
- Generate .o Files
- Generate .h Files
- Link .o Files to Other .o Files
- Optional Type Instead of Null Pointer
- Arguments With nonnull Attribute
- Same As __attribute__((nonnull)) in GCC
- Error Set as a Primitive
- Error Union as a Primitive
- Error Set Inference
- defer, errdefer
- try, catch, catch unreachable
- No Cognitive Overhead to Ensure Coverage of Every Exit Path
- Pre-Weight Bracnhes In Favour of Errors Not Occuring
- Calling Dynamically Linked Functions is Slow
- Alternatives to Preprocessor
- Conditional Compilation Via builtin
- Compile-time Array Concatenation Operator ++

##### Takeaways
```yaml
- Compile-Time Parameters for Generics
- Compile-Time Duck Typing
- Types Are First Class Citizens
- Implicit Inline If Expressions When Condition is Known At Compile-Time
- Compiler Skips Analysis of Branch Not Taken
- Switch-es are Implicitly Inlined when target Expression is compile-time known
- Inlining Loops Is Possible
- Partial CompileTime Eval & Partial RunTime Eval of Fn Is Possible
- Compile Time Eval Can Generate Multiple Implementations of A Single Function
- Compile Time Variables
- Compile Time Expressions
- Compiler Evaluates The CompileTime Expressions To Actual Values At Compile Time
- You Get Pre Computed Answers
- You Can Initialize Complex Static Data At Compile Time
- You Can Generate Generic Data Structures At Compile Time i.e. Generics
- All Aggregate Types Are Anonymous
- To Give Type A Name It Is Assigned To A Const
- Anonymous struct
- All Top Level Declarations Are Order-Independent
- If There's No Infinite Regression, Values can Refer to Themselves e.g. Binary Tree Node
- CompileTime Evaluations Is The Meta Programming Using Pure Zig

##### Takeaways
```yaml
- Redefining a Variable is an Error
- Bare Pointer i.e. &c_int
- Nullable Bare Pointer i.e. ?&c_int
- ?? unwraps the nullable value
- ?? also asserts that value is not null
- ?? if unwraps to null then behaviour is undefined
- Undefined Behaviour in Release Mode Just Like In C
- Undefined Behaviour Will Crash in Debug Mode
- Test code sufficiently in debug mode to catch undefined behavior abuse
- Utilize the safe-release option which includes the runtime undefined behavior safety checks
- Does Not Support Direct Pointer Arithmetic
- Pointer Indexing
```
