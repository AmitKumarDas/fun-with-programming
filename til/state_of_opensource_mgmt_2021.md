### State of OpenSource Management 2021

### Vision
- Ideas for projects, products, solutions, APIs, etc
- Ideas to sponsor the maintainers & hence the open source community

### Development Cycle
- Before code
  - setup automation
  - release automation
  - doc automation
  - linter automation
  - local dev loop automation
  - unit &/ integration automation
  - e2e automation
  - issue template
- During code
  - PR with couple of commits
  - rework PR immediately after above PR gets merged
  - 1 commit with max 2 files
  - developer have their local WIP branches
  - when developer are done in their WIP branch they send PR from specific feature branch(-es)
  - Plugin based, composable, extensions, library, tracing, metrics comes before API
  - API - both with & without
  - DB - both with & without
  - Declarative - YAML / Starlark / HCL - on top of API as well as library
  - when API generate the SDK
  - when API generate the website for API schema
  - when API then proxy, load balancer, security, analytics
  - APIs are great to test the product
- Post code
  - bugs to compliance kit
  - bugs to post mortem analysis kit
- Process
  - `til` repo
    - consist of relevant learnt items / links in md file(s)
    - similar to awesome list
  - `proposals` repo
    - issues will have problem statement, solutions & comments
    - issue graduates to a proposal md file
  - use `MIRO` to state the team's work
    - how to commercialise
    - effective open source
    - confirm the vision
    - what's happening now
    - what has changed
    - change or no change in strategy when customers come in
    - change or no change in strategy when community grows
    - change or no change in strategy when we have multiple releases
    - change or no change in strategy at scale
  - standups should have following (every day can have a different theme)
    - code reviews
    - happiness reviews
    - retrospectives
    - vision reviews
  - rules
    - no more than 2 meetings per day
    - some days can be no meeting day
    - team events that force team to travel together, explore things beyond code
    - should run, manage, upgrade, automate, scale, etc. the solution in EKS
  - tools
    - [+] GitHub
    - [+] MIRO
    - [+] EKS
    - [-] JIRA
    - [-] Confluence
    - [~] PPTs

### Project should
- have its own compliance kit
- have its own Post Mortem Analysis Kit 
  - what if there is no source code or logs or maintainers 
  - PMA kit should still be able to identify the issue
- learn from bugs, wars, troubleshooting articles
- learn from other projects'
  - release notes
  - LWKD
  - webinars
  - slacks
  - engineering blogs
