### State of Performance Engineering 2021

### Assembly | Compiler | Instructions | Interpreter
```yaml
- see the CPU instructions generated by the Go compiler
- need a disassembler 
- e.g. objdump which comes with the GNU binutils - may already be installed if Linux

- push instructions to add values onto the stack vs. placement onto the stack using mov
- performance - mov requires fewer CPU cycles than a push
