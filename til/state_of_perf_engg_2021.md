### State of Performance Engineering 2021

### Golang
```yaml
- input and output is handled using std io.go

- I/O is buffered for efficiency
- use bufio.Scanner to read input
- use bufio.Writer to buffer output
```

### Golang - Fuzz Testing
```yaml
- https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-parser-meet-go-fuzzer/
- RRDNS in-house DNS server
- uses github.com/miekgs/dns for all its parsing needs
- panicks on malformed packets
- this is Go, not C, and we can afford to recover() panics 
- no worrying about ending up with insane memory states
```

```go
func ParseDNSPacketSafely(buf []byte, msg *old.Msg) (err error) {
	defer func() {
		panicked := recover()

		if panicked != nil {
			err = errors.New("ParseError")
		}
	}()

	err = msg.Unpack(buf)
	return
}
```

### Assembly | Compiler | Instructions | Interpreter
```yaml
- see the CPU instructions generated by the Go compiler
- need a disassembler 
- e.g. objdump which comes with the GNU binutils - may already be installed if Linux

- push instructions to add values onto the stack vs. placement onto the stack using mov
- performance - mov requires fewer CPU cycles than a push

- https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk/
- awk interpreter in go

- https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-generated-types/
- workers - rust - typescript - intermediate representation
- abstract syntax tree
```
