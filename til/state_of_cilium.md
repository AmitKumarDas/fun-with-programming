### Then & Now
```yaml
- Connection logging back in the days of tcpd is now Tracing
- Access control on IP level:
  - evolved into authorization on the application protocol level, e.g. JWT
- Host name verification has been replaced:
  - with much stronger authentication such as mutual TLS
- Network load-balancing has been extended with L7 traffic management capabilities
- HTTP retries are the new TCP retransmissions
- What used to be solved with blackhole routes is called circuit breaking today
```
