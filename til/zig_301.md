#### Union
```yaml
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-c/
```

```yaml
- store Different Data Types in the same memory location
- a union with many members, but only 1 member can contain a value at any given time
- provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose
- storage is allocated based on the largest field size
- storage is not additive like struct
```

#### When In Zig You Name Explicitly
```yaml
- const Hey = struct {...}         // Zig
- struct Hey {...}                 // Is Rust & Not Zig
- var array = []u8{1}              // Zig Again
- var array align(4) = []u8{1}     // Zig With 4 bytes Alignment
```

#### Null Coalescing Operator ??
```yaml
- null-coalescing operator ?? returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't null
- Else it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result
- ?? operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null
```

#### Friendlier Error Syntax
```yaml
- %return is replaced with try
- %defer is replaced with errdefer
- a %% b is replaced with a catch b
- %%x is removed entirely to discourage its use
  - You can get an equivalent effect with x catch unreachable
  - Attempt to unwrap an error union
```
