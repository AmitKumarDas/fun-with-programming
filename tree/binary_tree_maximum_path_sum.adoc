=== Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

==== Understand
[source, bash]
----
- A path can be from any node to any node
- Need to find the maximum sum for a path
  - Path may be long or small. Does not matter
- Node can have positive as well as negative values
----

==== How
[source, bash]
----
- initialize maxSum = root.Val
- in-order traversal
- maxSum = maximum(maxSum, left + right + root, left + root, right + root, root)
- return max(left+root, right+root, root)
