=== Alien Dictionary

==== What?
[source, bash]
----
Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, 
find order of characters in the language
----

==== How?
[source, bash]
----
- Given an array of words/strings
- var order []byte
- var seen byte
- for idx, word := range words
  - c = word[0]
  - if idx == 0 seen = c 
    - order = append(order, c)
    - continue
  - if c == seen 
    - continue
  - else
    - seen = c
    - order = append(order, c)
- return order

- Above is WRONG
- BAD Assumption
- It might happen that there are no words beginning with certain chars
- These chars might appear in some other words in positions other than first
- So position of chars might be completely random in a word
