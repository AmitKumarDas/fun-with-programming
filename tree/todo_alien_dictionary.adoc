=== Alien Dictionary

==== What?
[source, bash]
----
Given a sorted dictionary (array of words) of an alien language, 
find order of characters in the language
----

==== How?
[source, bash]
----
- Given an array of words/strings
- var order []byte
- var seen byte
- for idx, word := range words
  - c = word[0]
  - if idx == 0 seen = c 
    - order = append(order, c)
    - continue
  - if c == seen 
    - continue
  - else
    - seen = c
    - order = append(order, c)
- return order

- Above is WRONG
- BAD Assumption
- It might happen that there are no words beginning with certain chars
- These chars might appear in some other words in positions other than first
- So position of chars might be completely random in a word
----

==== How - Attempt 2
[source, bash]
----
Input:  words[] = {"baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"}
Output: Order of characters is 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c'

- loop the dictionary
  - build graph of nodes & adjacents from first char
- loop through all words with 2 pointers - slow & fast
  - for every two words if their initial chars match
    - build graph of nodes & adjacents from the mismatching chars
  - increment slow pointer & reset fast pointer to slow pointer + 1 if chars mismatch
- run a DFS on graph
  - mark a node as visited when all its adjacents are visited
  - push visited node to stack
- return stack

- So we need to build Graph
- We need to do a DFS
- We need to mark a node as visited when all adjacents are visited
- Do something with visited
