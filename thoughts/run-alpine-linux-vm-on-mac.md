## Motivation
I need a Linux based VM on my mac to run things specific to eBPF or Chainguard's Melange or to run
apko on mac.

### Take 1 (Sep 2022)
Most fo steps to spin a Linux VM was found at [lima-for-apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/blob/main/mac/lima/apko-playground.yaml).
I needed a lima VM to [run-apko-on-mac](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/blob/main/mac/README.md#apko-on-mac).
