## Motivation
This helps learn some memory techniques. This may, possibly be handy in writing logic without
lots of allocations. Note that reduced allocations might give better latency numbers since
there is less pressure on garbage collector.

## Cross Compile with zig
```shell
CGO_ENABLED=1 \
GOOS=linux \
GOARCH=amd64 \
CC="zig cc -target x86_64-linux" \
CXX="zig c++ -target x86_64-linux" \
go build --tags extended
```

```yaml
- Zig calls x86_64 what Go calls amd64
```
