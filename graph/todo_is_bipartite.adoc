=== Check if Graph is Bipartite

==== What
[source, bash]
----
- A Bipartite Graph consists of vertices that can be divided into 2 independent sets
- Each edge should have one vertex lying in one set while other vertex in other set
----

==== How
[source, bash]
----
- use two color schemes
- loop across vertices
  - if vertex not colored then set color=blue
  - loop across adjacents
    - if vertex is color return false
    - if vertex is !color continue
    - if vertex is not colored color !color
- return true

- O(n^2) runtime complexity
----

==== How - Attempt 2
[source, bash]
----
- visualize the graph as a tree
- every depth will have its color toggled
- all nodes in a depth must have same color

- use two color maps
- start fromm root vertex
  - add vertex to blue map[vertex]bool
  - set color to blue
  - add vertex to Q
  - while Q not empty
    - fetch all adjacents
    - loop each adjacent
      - if adjacent not in any set add to red map[vertex]bool
      - if adjacent is in blue set return false
      - add to Q
    - toggle color
- return true

// runtime complexity same as BFS i.e o(v^2)
// O(v^2) runtime where v = no of vertices

// ---------
// IMPROVISATIONS
// ---------
- may represent entire graph as [][]int with source/root as an int
- i.e. graph [][]int, source int
- graph[u][v] == 1 implies edge exists

- may use []int when vertex value is index
- -1, 0, 1 are values
- -1 is no color
- 0 is color
- 1 is alternate color

- if graph is represented as adjacency list then runtime complexity is o(v+e)
