### Practices

#### Code Scars
```bash
- Recursion Does its Magic
  - When exit conditions are well defined
- Do not copy the Recursion code blocks
  - Into DP code block AS-IS

- DP & Max / Min - I
  - Major logic should be inside main dp filling block
  - Mostly if-elif-else blocks
  - Minimize Initial DP fill logic

- DP & Max / Min - II
  - Think Where the Max / Min Value will Percolate in DP Table
  - Will it be Top Right Cell of DP Table?
  - Will it be DP Table Edges?

- DP Table & Palindrome
  - Bottom Part of Diagonal is Useless
  - Fill Top Part of Diagonal only

- Do Not use Left, Right Pointer Movements in DP problems
- DP Is About Constructing the Equation
- DP Equation Is Composed Of Other Equations
```

#### DP
- Longest Palindromic Substring `table` `diagonal` `loop` `if-elif`
- Longest Palindromic SubSequence `table` `diagonal` `loop` `if-elif`

#### Array
- [GBRRBRG]_to_[RRRGGBB] i.e. Dutch Flag Problem `loop` `2-pointer` `rune` `swap` `if-elif`
