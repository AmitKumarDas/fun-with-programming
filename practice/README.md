### Practices

#### Code Scars
```bash
- Recursion Does its Magic
  - When exit conditions are well defined
- Do not copy the Recursion code blocks
  - Into DP code block AS-IS

- When DP & Max / Min
  - Then major logic should be inside main dp filling block
  - Minimize initial DP fill logic

- DP Table & Palindrome
  - Bottom Part of Diagonal is Useless
  - Fill Top Part of Diagonal only

- Do Not use Left, Right Pointer Movements in DP problems
- DP Is About Constructing the Equation
- DP Equation Is Composed Of Other Equations
```

#### DP
- Longest Palindromic Substring `table` `diagonal` `loop` `if-elif`
- Longest Palindromic SubSequence `table` `diagonal` `loop` `if-elif`
