Writes are expensive        Transactional & Disk Seek

1 disk seek                 10ms
In 1s                       1s/10ms = 100 seeks/sec

                            Need to be Consistent
                            Easily Cached

1MB data from Memory        250usec
In 1s                       1s/250usec = 4GB/sec
If 1MB entity               4000 fetches per sec
