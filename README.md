## Fun With Programming
In this repo, I document my operations' experiences as reports

### A report is written like README but can be run like shell 
A report is a markdown file whose code blocks can be executed
For example take a look at `k8s/carvel-packaging` folder

Notes: 
- _One needs to install `mask` to run these markdown files_
- _A report file is named as `maskfile.md`_

```shell
brew install mask
```

### k8s
This has my experience reports on things related to Kubernetes
