## Fun With Programming
In this repo, I document my operations' experiences as reports

### A report is written like README but can be run like shell 
A report is a markdown files whose code blocks are executable. A report i.e a `.md` file.
For example take a look at `k8s/carvel-packaging` folder

One needs to install `mask` to run these markdown files. A report file is named as `maskfile.md`

```shell
brew install mask
```

### k8s
This has my experience reports on things related to Kubernetes
